# ETA Mechanism Overview


## What is the ETA mechanism?

It is a simple back pressure mechanism that is applicable to notaries and nodes above minimum platform version 4. Using a
configured ETA threshold we compare the measured throughput and determine if the request is going to take more than that,
which if true - we respond with a back pressure message.


## How is the ETA calculated?

By inspecting the amount of states in the request queue and comparing that to the throughput measured in states per minute,
the number of seconds until a new request can be processed is calculated.


## Why is there an ETA mechanism?

Like any other form of back pressure, it is to prevent queuing redundant requests by retrying requests before the expected
time of handling the original request. Queuing additional redundant requests creates unnecessary work for the notary service
using up resources for processing these redundant requests that could otherwise be used for new requests. Retrying the requests
too eagerly prevents the notary from running at peak throughput.


## What happens if I just invoke FinalityFlow again after getting told to wait?

If a Corda node is told to wait, its state machine will handle the wait and nothing will be visible to the CorDapp.
Even if a client runs a modified Corda node heâ€™ll get cut off by the ETA once again and hardly see any benefit.
While the ETA can hardly be accurate, it is a close approximation of the time when response will arrive.
The ETA mechanism is in place to maximize the throughput of the notary service assuming clients wait before retrying
their requests as intended.


## How can I configure ETA threshold?

In the notary config - `notaryConfig.etaMessageThresholdSeconds`.
