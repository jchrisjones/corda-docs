# Writing vault queries



## Overview

Corda has been architected from the ground up to encourage usage of industry standard, proven query frameworks and
libraries for accessing RDBMS backed transactional stores (including the Vault).

Corda provides a number of flexible query mechanisms for accessing the Vault:


* Vault Query API
* Using a JDBC session (as described in Persistence)
* Custom [JPA](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html)/[JPQL](http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/current/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#hql) queries
* Custom 3rd party Data Access frameworks such as [Spring Data](http://projects.spring.io/spring-data)

The majority of query requirements can be satisfied by using the Vault Query API, which is exposed via the
`VaultService` for use directly by flows:

And via `CordaRPCOps` for use by RPC client applications:

Helper methods are also provided with default values for arguments:

The API provides both static (snapshot) and dynamic (snapshot with streaming updates) methods for a defined set of
filter criteria:


* Use `queryBy` to obtain a current snapshot of data (for a given `QueryCriteria`)
* Use `trackBy` to obtain both a current snapshot and a future stream of updates (for a given `QueryCriteria`)

{{< note >}}
Streaming updates are only filtered based on contract type and state status (UNCONSUMED, CONSUMED, ALL).
They will not respect any other criteria that the initial query has been filtered by.

{{< /note >}}
Simple pagination (page number and size) and sorting (directional ordering using standard or custom property
attributes) is also specifiable. Defaults are defined for paging (pageNumber = 1, pageSize = 200) and sorting
(direction = ASC).

The `QueryCriteria` interface provides a flexible mechanism for specifying different filtering criteria, including
and/or composition and a rich set of operators to include:


* Binary logical (AND, OR)
* Comparison (LESS_THAN, LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL, GREATER_THAN, GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL)
* Equality (EQUAL, NOT_EQUAL)
* Likeness (LIKE, NOT_LIKE)
* Nullability (IS_NULL, NOT_NULL)
* Collection based (IN, NOT_IN)
* Standard SQL-92 aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT)

There are four implementations of this interface which can be chained together to define advanced filters.


* `VaultQueryCriteria` provides filterable criteria on attributes within the Vault states table: status (UNCONSUMED,
CONSUMED), state reference(s), contract state type(s), notaries, soft locked states, timestamps (RECORDED, CONSUMED),
state constraints (see [Constraint Types](api-contract-constraints.md#implicit-constraint-types)), relevancy (ALL, RELEVANT, NON_RELEVANT),
participants (exact or any match).>
{{< note >}}
Sensible defaults are defined for frequently used attributes (status = UNCONSUMED, always include soft
locked states).{{< /note >}}


* `FungibleAssetQueryCriteria` provides filterable criteria on attributes defined in the Corda Core
`FungibleAsset` contract state interface, used to represent assets that are fungible, countable and issued by a
specific party (eg. `Cash.State` and `CommodityContract.State` in the Corda finance module). Filterable
attributes include: participants (exact or any match), owner(s), quantity, issuer party(s) and issuer reference(s).>
{{< note >}}
All contract states that extend the `FungibleAsset` now automatically persist that interfaces common
state attributes to the **vault_fungible_states** table.{{< /note >}}


* `LinearStateQueryCriteria` provides filterable criteria on attributes defined in the Corda Core `LinearState`
and `DealState` contract state interfaces, used to represent entities that continuously supersede themselves, all
of which share the same `linearId` (e.g. trade entity states such as the `IRSState` defined in the SIMM
valuation demo). Filterable attributes include: participants (exact or any match), linearId(s), uuid(s), and externalId(s).>
{{< note >}}
All contract states that extend `LinearState` or `DealState` now automatically persist those
interfaces common state attributes to the **vault_linear_states** table.{{< /note >}}


* `VaultCustomQueryCriteria` provides the means to specify one or many arbitrary expressions on attributes defined
by a custom contract state that implements its own schema as described in the Persistence
documentation and associated examples. Custom criteria expressions are expressed using one of several type-safe
`CriteriaExpression`: BinaryLogical, Not, ColumnPredicateExpression, AggregateFunctionExpression. The
`ColumnPredicateExpression` allows for specification arbitrary criteria using the previously enumerated operator
types. The `AggregateFunctionExpression` allows for the specification of an aggregate function type (sum, avg,
max, min, count) with optional grouping and sorting. Furthermore, a rich DSL is provided to enable simple
construction of custom criteria using any combination of `ColumnPredicate`. See the `Builder` object in
`QueryCriteriaUtils` for a complete specification of the DSL.>
{{< note >}}
Custom contract schemas are automatically registered upon node startup for CorDapps. Please refer to
Persistence for mechanisms of registering custom schemas for different testing
purposes.{{< /note >}}



All `QueryCriteria` implementations are composable using `and` and `or` operators.

All `QueryCriteria` implementations provide an explicitly specifiable set of common attributes:


* State status attribute (`Vault.StateStatus`), which defaults to filtering on UNCONSUMED states.
When chaining several criteria using AND / OR, the last value of this attribute will override any previous
* Contract state types (`<Set<Class<out ContractState>>`), which will contain at minimum one type (by default this
will be `ContractState` which resolves to all state types). When chaining several criteria using `and` and
`or` operators, all specified contract state types are combined into a single set

An example of a custom query is illustrated here:

{{< note >}}
Custom contract states that implement the `Queryable` interface may now extend common schemas types
`FungiblePersistentState` or, `LinearPersistentState`.  Previously, all custom contracts extended the root
`PersistentState` class and defined repeated mappings of `FungibleAsset` and `LinearState` attributes. See
`SampleCashSchemaV2` and `DummyLinearStateSchemaV2` as examples.

{{< /note >}}
Examples of these `QueryCriteria` objects are presented below for Kotlin and Java.

{{< note >}}
When specifying the `ContractType` as a parameterised type to the `QueryCriteria` in Kotlin, queries now
include all concrete implementations of that type if this is an interface. Previously, it was only possible to query
on concrete types (or the universe of all `ContractState`).

{{< /note >}}
The Vault Query API leverages the rich semantics of the underlying JPA [Hibernate](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/jpa/2.1/api/) based
Persistence framework adopted by Corda.


{{< note >}}
Permissioning at the database level will be enforced at a later date to ensure authenticated, role-based,
read-only access to underlying Corda tables.

{{< /note >}}
{{< note >}}
APIâ€™s now provide ease of use calling semantics from both Java and Kotlin. However, it should be noted that
Java custom queries are significantly more verbose due to the use of reflection fields to reference schema attribute
types.

{{< /note >}}
An example of a custom query in Java is illustrated here:

{{< note >}}
Queries by `Party` specify the `AbstractParty` which may be concrete or anonymous. In the later case,
where an anonymous party does not resolve to an X500 name via the `IdentityService`, no query results will ever be
produced. For performance reasons, queries do not use `PublicKey` as search criteria.

{{< /note >}}
Custom queries can be either case sensitive or case insensitive. They are defined via a `Boolean` as one of the function parameters of each operator function. By default each operator is case sensitive.

An example of a case sensitive custom query operator is illustrated here:

{{< tabs name="tabs-1" >}}
{{% tab name="kotlin" %}}
```kotlin
val currencyIndex = PersistentCashState::currency.equal(USD.currencyCode, true)
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{< /tabs >}}

{{< note >}}
The `Boolean` input of `true` in this example could be removed since the function will default to `true` when not provided.

{{< /note >}}
An example of a case insensitive custom query operator is illustrated here:

{{< tabs name="tabs-2" >}}
{{% tab name="kotlin" %}}
```kotlin
val currencyIndex = PersistentCashState::currency.equal(USD.currencyCode, false)
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{< /tabs >}}

An example of a case sensitive custom query operator in Java is illustrated here:

{{< tabs name="tabs-3" >}}
{{% tab name="java" %}}
```java
FieldInfo attributeCurrency = getField("currency", CashSchemaV1.PersistentCashState.class);
CriteriaExpression currencyIndex = Builder.equal(attributeCurrency, "USD", true);
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{< /tabs >}}

An example of a case insensitive custom query operator in Java is illustrated here:

{{< tabs name="tabs-4" >}}
{{% tab name="java" %}}
```java
FieldInfo attributeCurrency = getField("currency", CashSchemaV1.PersistentCashState.class);
CriteriaExpression currencyIndex = Builder.equal(attributeCurrency, "USD", false);
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{< /tabs >}}


## Pagination

The API provides support for paging where large numbers of results are expected (by default, a page size is set to 200
results). Defining a sensible default page size enables efficient checkpointing within flows, and frees the developer
from worrying about pagination where result sets are expected to be constrained to 200 or fewer entries. Where large
result sets are expected (such as using the RPC API for reporting and/or UI display), it is strongly recommended to
define a `PageSpecification` to correctly process results with efficient memory utilisation. A fail-fast mode is in
place to alert API users to the need for pagination where a single query returns more than 200 results and no
`PageSpecification` has been supplied.

Hereâ€™s a query that extracts every unconsumed `ContractState` from the vault in pages of size 200, starting from the
default page number (page one):

{{< tabs name="tabs-5" >}}
{{% tab name="kotlin" %}}
```kotlin
val vaultSnapshot = proxy.vaultQueryBy<ContractState>(
    QueryCriteria.VaultQueryCriteria(Vault.StateStatus.UNCONSUMED),
    PageSpecification(DEFAULT_PAGE_NUM, 200))
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{< /tabs >}}

{{< note >}}
A pages maximum size `MAX_PAGE_SIZE` is defined as `Int.MAX_VALUE` and should be used with extreme
caution as results returned may exceed your JVMâ€™s memory footprint.

{{< /note >}}

## Example usage


### Kotlin

**General snapshot queries using** `VaultQueryCriteria`:

Query for all unconsumed states (simplest query possible):

Query for unconsumed states for some state references:

Query for unconsumed states for several contract state types:

Query for unconsumed states for specified contract state constraint types and sorted in ascending alphabetical order:

Query for unconsumed states for specified contract state constraints (type and data):

Query for unconsumed states for a given notary:

Query for unconsumed states for a given set of participants (matches any state that contains at least one of the specified participants):

Query for unconsumed states for a given set of participants (exactly matches only states that contain all specified participants):

Query for unconsumed states recorded between two time intervals:

{{< note >}}
This example illustrates usage of a `Between` `ColumnPredicate`.

{{< /note >}}
Query for all states with pagination specification (10 results per page):

{{< note >}}
The result set metadata field *totalStatesAvailable* allows you to further paginate accordingly as
demonstrated in the following example.

{{< /note >}}
Query for all states using a pagination specification and iterate using the *totalStatesAvailable* field until no further
pages available:

Query for only relevant states in the vault:

**LinearState and DealState queries using** `LinearStateQueryCriteria`:

Query for unconsumed linear states for given linear ids:

Query for all linear states associated with a linear id:

Query for unconsumed deal states with deals references:

Query for unconsumed deal states with deals parties (any match):

Query for unconsumed deal states with deals parties (exact match):

Query for only relevant linear states in the vault:

**FungibleAsset and DealState queries using** `FungibleAssetQueryCriteria`:

Query for fungible assets for a given currency:

Query for fungible assets for a minimum quantity:

{{< note >}}
This example uses the builder DSL.

{{< /note >}}
Query for fungible assets for a specific issuer party:

Query for only relevant fungible states in the vault:

**Aggregate Function queries using** `VaultCustomQueryCriteria`:

{{< note >}}
Query results for aggregate functions are contained in the `otherResults` attribute of a results Page.

{{< /note >}}
Aggregations on cash using various functions:

{{< note >}}
`otherResults` will contain 5 items, one per calculated aggregate function.

{{< /note >}}
Aggregations on cash grouped by currency for various functions:

{{< note >}}
`otherResults` will contain 24 items, one result per calculated aggregate function per currency (the
grouping attribute - currency in this case - is returned per aggregate result).

{{< /note >}}
Sum aggregation on cash grouped by issuer party and currency and sorted by sum:

{{< note >}}
`otherResults` will contain 12 items sorted from largest summed cash amount to smallest, one result per
calculated aggregate function per issuer party and currency (grouping attributes are returned per aggregate result).

{{< /note >}}
Dynamic queries (also using `VaultQueryCriteria`) are an extension to the snapshot queries by returning an
additional `QueryResults` return type in the form of an `Observable<Vault.Update>`. Refer to
[ReactiveX Observable](http://reactivex.io/documentation/observable.html) for a detailed understanding and usage of
this type.

Track unconsumed cash states:

Track unconsumed linear states:

{{< note >}}
This will return both `DealState` and `LinearState` states.

{{< /note >}}
Track unconsumed deal states:

{{< note >}}
This will return only `DealState` states.

{{< /note >}}

### Java examples

Query for all unconsumed linear states:

Query for all consumed cash states:

Query for consumed deal states or linear ids, specify a paging specification and sort by unique identifier:

Query for all states using a pagination specification and iterate using the *totalStatesAvailable* field until no further pages available:

**Aggregate Function queries using** `VaultCustomQueryCriteria`:

Aggregations on cash using various functions:

Aggregations on cash grouped by currency for various functions:

Sum aggregation on cash grouped by issuer party and currency and sorted by sum:

Track unconsumed cash states:

Track unconsumed deal states or linear states (with snapshot including specification of paging and sorting by unique
identifier):


## Troubleshooting

If the results your were expecting do not match actual returned query results we recommend you add an entry to your
`log4j2.xml` configuration file to enable display of executed SQL statements:

```kotlin
<Logger name="org.hibernate.SQL" level="debug" additivity="false">

    <AppenderRef ref="Console-Appender"/>

</Logger>
```


## Behavioural notes


* `TrackBy` updates do not take into account the full criteria specification due to different and more restrictive
syntax in [observables](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki) filtering (vs full SQL-92 JDBC filtering as used
in snapshot views). Specifically, dynamic updates are filtered by `contractStateType` and `stateType`
(UNCONSUMED, CONSUMED, ALL) only
* `QueryBy` and `TrackBy` snapshot views using pagination may return different result sets as each paging request
is a separate SQL query on the underlying database, and it is entirely conceivable that state modifications are
taking place in between and/or in parallel to paging requests. When using pagination, always check the value of the
`totalStatesAvailable` (from the `Vault.Page` result) and adjust further paging requests appropriately.


## Other use case scenarios

For advanced use cases that require sophisticated pagination, sorting, grouping, and aggregation functions, it is
recommended that the CorDapp developer utilise one of the many proven frameworks that ship with this capability out of
the box. Namely, implementations of JPQL (JPA Query Language) such as Hibernate for advanced SQL access, and
Spring Data for advanced pagination and ordering constructs.

The Corda Tutorials provide examples satisfying these additional Use Cases:

* Example CorDapp service query extension executing Named Queries via [JPQL](http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/current/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#hql)
* [Advanced pagination](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/PagingAndSortingRepository.html) queries using Spring Data [JPA](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html)






## Mapping owning keys to external IDs

When creating new public keys via the `KeyManagementService`, it is possible to create an association between the newly created public
key and an external ID. This, in effect, allows CorDapp developers to group state ownership/participation keys by an account ID.

{{< note >}}
This only works with freshly generated public keys and *not* the nodeâ€™s legal identity key. If you require that the freshly
generated keys be for the nodeâ€™s identity then use `PersistentKeyManagementService.freshKeyAndCert` instead of `freshKey`.
Currently, the generation of keys for other identities is not supported.

{{< /note >}}
The code snippet below show how keys can be associated with an external ID by using the exposed JPA functionality:

{{< tabs name="tabs-6" >}}
{{% tab name="java" %}}
```java
public AnonymousParty freshKeyForExternalId(UUID externalId, ServiceHub services) {
    // Create a fresh key pair and return the public key.
    AnonymousParty anonymousParty = freshKey();
    // Associate the fresh key to an external ID.
    services.withEntityManager(entityManager -> {
        PersistentKeyManagementService.PublicKeyHashToExternalId mapping = PersistentKeyManagementService.PublicKeyHashToExternalId(externalId, anonymousParty.owningKey);
        entityManager.persist(mapping);
        return null;
    });
    return anonymousParty;
}
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab name="kotlin" %}}
```kotlin
fun freshKeyForExternalId(externalId: UUID, services: ServiceHub): AnonymousParty {
    // Create a fresh key pair and return the public key.
    val anonymousParty = freshKey()
    // Associate the fresh key to an external ID.
    services.withEntityManager {
        val mapping = PersistentKeyManagementService.PublicKeyHashToExternalId(externalId, anonymousParty.owningKey)
        persist(mapping)
    }
    return anonymousParty
}
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{< /tabs >}}

As can be seen in the code snippet above, the `PublicKeyHashToExternalId` entity has been added to `PersistentKeyManagementService`,
which allows you to associate your public keys with external IDs. So far, so good.

{{< note >}}
Here, it is worth noting that we must map **owning keys** to external IDs, as opposed to **state objects**. This is because it
might be the case that a `LinearState` is owned by two public keys generated by the same node.

{{< /note >}}
The intuition here is that when these public keys are used to own or participate in a state object, it is trivial to then associate those
states with a particular external ID. Behind the scenes, when states are persisted to the vault, the owning keys for each state are
persisted to a `PersistentParty` table. The `PersistentParty` table can be joined with the `PublicKeyHashToExternalId` table to create
a view which maps each state to one or more external IDs. The entity relationship diagram below helps to explain how this works.

![state to external id](/en/images/state-to-external-id.png "state to external id")
When performing a vault query, it is now possible to query for states by external ID using the `externalIds` parameter in
`VaultQueryCriteria`.
